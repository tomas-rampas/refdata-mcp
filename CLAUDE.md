# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP-RAG Banking Reference Data System - a .NET-based Model Context Protocol server with Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities designed for banking reference data teams. The system helps teams query policies, procedures, and reference data using natural language while maintaining accuracy and compliance standards.

## Code Guidelines

- Always provide comment for public classes including its purpose
- Always provide comment public methods including its purpose, if method comes form interface put the comment there and only refer to it in the class
- Always create unit tests for classes or set of classes which should be unit tested. Include positive and negative test scenarios automatically
- Run `dotnet build` in .\src directory after every completed task and fix all errors and warnings

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Data Sources**: Jira, Confluence, and local files
- **Document Processing**: Specialized parsers for banking documents
- **Vector Storage**: MongoDB with vector search
- **LLM Integration**: Local Ollama instance
- **Background Services**: Timer-based ingestion
- **API & Client**: RESTful API with Blazor WASM frontend

## Project Status
