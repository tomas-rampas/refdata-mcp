# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP-RAG Banking Reference Data System - a .NET-based Model Context Protocol server with Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities designed for banking reference data teams. The system helps teams query policies, procedures, and reference data using natural language while maintaining accuracy and compliance standards.

## Code Guidelines

- Always provide comment for public classes including its purpose
- Always provide comment public methods including its purpose, if method comes form interface put the comment there and only refer to it in the class
- Always create unit tests for classes or set of classes which should be unit tested. Include positive and negative test scenarios automatically
- Run `dotnet build` in .\src directory after every completed task and fix all errors and warnings
- Rubn `dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal` and fix all errors and warnings

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Data Sources**: Jira, Confluence, and local files
- **Document Processing**: Specialized parsers for banking documents
- **Vector Storage**: MongoDB with vector search
- **LLM Integration**: Local Ollama instance
- **Background Services**: Timer-based ingestion
- **API & Client**: RESTful API with Blazor WASM frontend

## Project Status

### Completed Phases
- âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** - Docker setup, project structure, solution and projects created
- âœ… **Phase 2: Core Domain Models** - All entities, interfaces, and enums implemented
- âœ… **Phase 3: Infrastructure Implementation** - All infrastructure services, parsers, and clients implemented
- âœ… **Phase 4: Application Services & API** - Application services, DTOs, API controllers, DI configuration, and settings completed
- âœ… **Phase 5: Client Application** - Blazor WASM client with Chat and Ingestion pages, ApiClient service, and banking-themed UI

### Current Phase
- âœ… **Phase 6: Docker & Deployment** - Dockerfiles and docker-compose configuration completed
- ðŸš§ **Phase 7: Testing & Documentation** - Unit and integration tests in progress (tasks 172-181 completed)

### Key Implementation Notes
- All services are registered in DI container with appropriate lifetimes
- API includes comprehensive Swagger documentation
- Health check endpoints are available for monitoring
- Background ingestion service is configured to run periodically
- CORS is configured for local development
- Blazor client includes chat interface and ingestion management
- Banking-appropriate styling applied throughout the UI

## Vector Database Considerations

### Current Limitation
- MongoDB vector search (`$vectorSearch`) is only available in MongoDB Atlas (cloud service)
- Local MongoDB containers do not support vector search operations
- Integration tests requiring vector search are marked as skipped

### Alternative Vector Databases for Local Development
1. **Apache Cassandra 5.0** - Native vector search support in open-source version
2. **PostgreSQL with pgvector** - Mature extension for vector operations
3. **Qdrant** - Purpose-built vector database with excellent Docker support
4. **Weaviate** - Vector-first database with GraphQL API
5. **ChromaDB** - Lightweight embedded vector database

### MongoDB Atlas CLI Option
- MongoDB offers Atlas CLI for local development with vector search
- Requires `atlas deployments setup` command
- Creates local Atlas deployment that supports `$vectorSearch`
