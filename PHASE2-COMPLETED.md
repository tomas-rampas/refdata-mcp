# Phase 2 Core Domain Models - Completed ✓

## Summary
All Phase 2 tasks (21-70) have been successfully completed. The core domain models and interfaces for the MCP-RAG Banking Reference Data System are now in place.

## Completed Structure

### Entity Classes
```
src/McpServer.Core/Entities/
├── DocumentChunk.cs       # Main document storage unit with embeddings
├── DocumentMetadata.cs    # Banking-specific metadata
├── IngestionJob.cs       # Track document processing jobs
└── ChatRequest.cs        # Store user queries and responses
```

### Core Interfaces
```
src/McpServer.Core/Interfaces/
├── IDocumentLoader.cs          # Load documents from various sources
├── IBankingDocumentParser.cs   # Parse and extract banking metadata
├── IChunkingService.cs         # Split documents into chunks
├── IVectorStore.cs             # Store and search embeddings
└── ILlmClient.cs               # Interface with LLM for embeddings/responses
```

### Enumerations
```
src/McpServer.Core/Enums/
├── DocumentType.cs       # Policy, Procedure, ReferenceData
└── IngestionStatus.cs    # Pending, InProgress, Completed, Failed, Cancelled
```

## Key Design Decisions

### DocumentChunk Entity
- Stores content with vector embeddings (float[])
- Links to source documents via SourceId
- Includes banking-specific metadata
- Tracks creation timestamp

### Banking-Specific Features
- DocumentMetadata includes Department, EffectiveDate, Version
- DocumentType enum for classification
- Specialized IBankingDocumentParser interface

### Clean Architecture
- All entities and interfaces in Core project
- No external dependencies in Core
- Ready for implementation in Infrastructure layer

## Build Status
✅ Solution builds successfully with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## Next Steps
Ready for Phase 3: Infrastructure Implementation (Tasks 71-122)
- Implement document loaders
- Create banking document parser
- Set up MongoDB vector store
- Integrate Ollama LLM client
- Build background ingestion service
